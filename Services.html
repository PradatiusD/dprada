        <h2 class="Servicesheader">Web design made a conversation</h2>
        <p>Web Design is not about installing graphics on a website, it is about creating tone, content, and energy that precisely matches your company culture and your target market.  This process is as strategic as any other element of marketing.  To begin, we will develop a keyword strategy to ensure that your domain, content, and target those specific audiences that your brand is best for.  Using <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/KeywordTool">Google’s Keyword Tool</a>, we’ll figure out what 3-5 keywords are most relevant to the customers that search your business.  From there we will find the domain, images, and content content that will get you the highest returing search engine presence.
          What kind of websites do we offer?  We offer three main types:</p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="span4">
        <h3>Landing Page</h3>
        <h4>Cause action</h4>
        <p>Landing pages are web pages where the goal is to cause action (donations, e-mail sign-ups, coupon registrations, ticket sales, special promotions). With few links, simple navigation, and a user-friendly interface, these pages are excellent for pitching a new company idea, for starting a new campaign, or for creating interest for a new initiative. This is a low-cost high value option, and highly recommended for small-scale projects. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="span4">
        <h3>WordPress Websites</h3>
        <h4>Professional and affordable</h4>
        <p>WordPress is a blogging platform that allows you to be able to create, maintain, and set up beautiful websites with minimal knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Javascript thanks to its massive theme database.  Using it, we can build a webpage specific to the person who wants a clean design that can be changed without having to contact us. Wordpress is great for a company/ individual searching for a way to have maximum control over the exact content of the webpage as time passes, but wants the elegance in design of custom-made work. Our services would involve registering the site, installing the wordpress platform, desiging the aesthetics as well as the navigation structure. Then we leave you with the keys to access and change your content.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="span4">
        <h3>Full-featured Website</h3>
        <h4>Maximum Possibilities</h4>
        <p>A full-featured website will give you immense choice and space for either you or us to be creative. Given the fact that, unlike WordPress, we can control all aspects of the website code and graphics, we can develop a design solution unique to what you have in mind. Additionally, we'll be able to create our own graphics and also implant them on the site. This is best if you plan on having more complicated content, like galleries, forms, e-commerce platforms, Google Analytics, company e-mails, social media integration, programs, etc.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="bottom2" class="Tabs" style="display:none"><div class="span12"><h3>We help you sell stuff</h3>
<p>From simple places to host your commercial goods like Shopify to a full service e-commerce platform like oSCommerce, we will help you bring your goods to the online marketplace.</p>
<h3>or Raise funding for your initiative</h3>
<p>Want to raise capital for a creative project or start-up?  We’ll help you set up a Kickstarter or a Indiegogo campaign to crowd-source the funding you need to materialize your vision.</p>
</div>
    </div>
    <div id="bottom3" class="Tabs" style="display:none"><div class="span12">
      <h2 class="Servicesheader">Building a website is only half the battle</h2>
      The next part is building the tools to be able to drive traffic to your webpage.  While most users of Search Engine Marketing (SEM) tend to be online stores, the importance of showing up on the first page on Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yelp or any other search Engine is critcal if you want to draw new customers to your enterprise.  While we offer no guarantees, we can offer you clear advice on how to improve this ranking as well as provide you the tools to manage your own advertisement campaigns on Facebook and Google.
      <h2 class="Servicesheader">Figuring out what is best for you</h2>
      <p>Not every single company needs to focus time, energy, and resources to improving online presence.  The two questions you should ask yourself are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How do new consumers find out about my company?</li>
        <li>How would a user look up your service?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This can help you see what a possible consumer might do, and help  you come up with an idea of how we here can help you achieve your marketing goals.</p>
      <p>We will start with selecting 3-5 keywords that concern your business and then tailor the coding and content to improve your rankings for those specific accounts.<a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/KeywordTool">Google Keyword Tool</a>. From here we will try to gear our language, coding, and design as many pathways to bringing in traffic.</p>
      <h3>Building Social Media</h3>
      <p>Social Media is a force little understood for most small business owners.  But it is crucial as part of a search engine marketing (SEM) campaign to improve your performance on search engines like Bing, Yahoo, Web.  After we optimize your webpage content for these search engines, we will proceed to focus first on social media players like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest and others since they are easy, low-cost, high-value ways to improve your website’s SEO performance.     Just take Facebook for example: it has more than 800 million monthly active users as of last year, and they all could be interacting with your content.  By publish material relevant to your audiences and likely to be shared, you can reach clients outside your client network. </p>
      <p>Building engaging content with your social media accounts will not only improve your appearance on search engines, it will also lead to higher traffic, better quality leads, and an audience for your goods or services.</p>

      <h3>Leveraging Special Offers</h3>
      Building compelling offers for clients will bring traffic and conversions, and so we will work with you to discover what kind of special deals we can offer to new customers that maximize your revenues and brand exposure.
      <h3>Payperclick advertising</h3>
      <p>After optimizing your webpage and social media, if you would like to go further, we can go and manage Pay per click marketing campaigns in order to bring additional traffic towards your webpage.  This is a method by which you pay only when a user actually clicks on the link to go to your page.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div id="bottom4" class="Tabs" style="display:none"><div class="span8">
        <h2 class="Servicesheader">Evaluating your strategy</h2>
        <p>Without a means to refine and evaluate your marketing strategy, there  is no way to know if the marketing strategy have implemented is succeeding or in need of improvement.</p>
        <h2 class="Servicesheader">Employing Google Analytics</h2>
        <p>By installing Google Analytics on your website, we can monitor and track the demographics, locations, operating systems, and profiles of the kinds of customers viewing your webpage.  With this data, we can build you reports that not only provide you with raw data, but also analysis on how we can modify your webpage to improve its visibility.</p>
        <p>As you can see from the sidebar to the right (which is a collage of cutouts from a report on our webpage as of September 21st) you can have precise information on the distribution of operating systems, cities, browsers, internet providers, returning/new, languages, internet service providers, mobile viewers, organic/referral/direct, and so much more.  With this wealth of data, we can work with you to understand exactly how your messaging needs to adapt to your audiences.</p>
        <h2 class="Servicesheader">Integrating your page with Google Adwords</h2>
        <p>In combination with Google Analytics, Google Adwords allows you directly monitor how your search engine marketing campaign is driving traffic to your webpage.</p>

<h2 class="Servicesheader">Bringing the sexay to paper</h2>        
<p>From Business cards to brochures to posters to event flyers to paper airplanes, we here at Prada Designers design graphics for any kind of print media publication.  We will work with you to ensure that your message comes across as clearly and as beautifully as it rightfully deserves.</p>
<p>We’ll first discuss if the medium chosen is appropriate for the end goal, and once we agree on the approach, we’ll use your logo, typography, and company colors, to build and deliver borderline orgasmic work.

        <h2 class="Servicesheader">Designed Presentations for you</h2>
        <p>The difference between a template-based PowerPoint and one that was hand crafted to match your business proposal is undeniable.  A visually appealing presentation, in combination with a message that is as concise and as clean as possible will make your presentation stand out amongst its peers. Using Powtoon, Prezi, Powerpoint, and ProShow, we offer the ability to redesign your current template-based presentation into something tactical and beautiful.  While we encourage you to try out and actually design presentations by yourself (most have free versions), we honestly believe that we can really leverage the maximum aesthetic and creative value to these software programs for your purposes. We will work with you to ensure that your message gets the clarity it deserves, so that you can deliver the highest value to your small business' bottom line.</p>
        <p>Here is the Prada Designers presentation:</p>

        <h2 class="Servicesheader">Speak on your behalf</h2>
<p>A statistical report confirmed that people are more afraid of public speaking than of death.  That means that, at a funeral, they would prefer being in the casket to giving the eulogy.  While funny, this reflects the importance of having people confident and comfortable in front of tough audiences willing to provide the best possible presentation of your brand. Each member of our team has demonstrated significant talent in the field of public speaking:  Carolina, as a seasoned marketer, has frequently presented her sales and marketing proposals to her boards at major global corporations.  We love you so much that, if you let us, we will gladly present your pitch in exchange for some possible amount of money.  Each of us is a confident public speaker.   As a tour guide for Brown Admissions, Daniel gave the same 1-hour presentation around 120 times to groups of 15-100 people, where he developed a comedy routine only suitable for the socially desperate high school students and their more alarming counterparts.</p>
<p>Below is an example:</p>

<p>Here am I, Daniel Prada, at Boston's AngelHack.  I apologize for the terrible audio/video quality, and I hope you understand that I had less than 2 hours to make this presentation in front of these nerds.</p>
