# Prada Designers Website

The code for this project is intended as a starter template for mobile-first projects, using the frameworks which I find to be the more time consuming to set up but by far the most useful in the long run.  Here are some of the files included in this project.
* Foundation Front-end Framework (http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/)
	* Using the SCSS standalone branch (https://github.com/zurb/foundation/tree/scss-standalone)
* Bourbon IO SASS mixin library (http://bourbon.io/docs/)
* Entypo Pictogram suite with the social extension (http://entypo.com/)
